# What is this?

Here is the server and client code for an implementation of Settlers of Catan I wrote last year.

I haven't made the effort to get all the things needed for it to build in the general case, 
I just had it building on my box in Eclipse. Hopefully the fact that the general user not willing to put a substantial
amount of effot in cannot even build the project will make it clear that this isn't a violation of anyone's copyright. 

I just wanted to get it up here so that people could check out the code.
